### How to use Chrono Park :
    

    ## Interface :


        # Compilation :

            Go to the GUI directory :
                cd src/GUI/
            Then to compile the program and generate the executable file :
                make gui

        
        # Execution :
        
            Once the program has been compiled, you can run the GUI program :
                ./gui
            You can refer to "# Description" where all options are described and explained.

        # Cleaning :

            You can clean all created files by typing :
                make clean

        
        # Description :

            First, you have to choose the paramaters that you want.
            When you have finished, click on the button "Start the simulation".
            A new window will pop with several options.
            On top left there are 2 numbers :
            	- time
            	- people remaining
            These numbers are usefull to see how the simulation evolves.
            Also, you can see from 2 to 12 attractions, depending the number you chosed
            in the parameters window. Next to each attractions there is a number which
            represents the number of people that are in the attraction.
            On right top oyou can see a button named "Go to menu" that is usefull to stop
            the simulation and go back to the menu if you want to change parameters and
            start again.


        # Quiting :

            You can quit the program at any time by clicking on the cross at the top right.
	   

   ## Algorithm :


        # Compilation :

           	Go to the Algo directory :
             	src/Algo/
           	Then to compile the program and generate the executable file :
           		make
           	When you compile theses files are used :
              	- List.h
            	- Graph.h
          		- Floyd.c
           	Dijkstra.c is not use and we won't compile it for the first defense.
           	We will speak about this one for the next one.


        # Execution :

           	Once the program has been compiled, you can run the Floyd program:
              	./Floyd
           	You can refer to "# Description" where all results are described and explained.


        # Cleaning :

           	You can clean all created files by typing :
     	   		make clean


        # Description :

           	First part you can see all edges of the graph we created.
           	Second part you can see the result of the Floyd algorithm.
           	It is a matrice where there are distances of each vertices from one of them.
           	For example the first line is the distance of each vertices from the first one.
    ## IA :
	
	# Compilation :
		Go to the IA directory :
             	src/IA/
           	Then to compile the program and generate the executable file :
           		make
		
	# Execution :
		Once the program has been compiled, you can run the population program:
		./population
	
	# Cleaning :
		You can clean all created files by typing :
			make clean
	
	# Description :
		The program print every 2 seconds an overview of the park
		You cans see each attractions and the amount of people in the parc
		Along with others parameters for each attractions.
		The only number that change between 2 prints is the numbers of people.
		So you can see people going from an attraction to another.
