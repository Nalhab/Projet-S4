### How to use Chrono Park :
    

    ## Interface :


        # Compilation :

            Go to the GUI directory :
                cd src/GUI/
            Then to compile the program and generate the executable file :
                make gui

        
        # Execution :
        
            Once the program has been compiled, you can run the GUI program :
                ./gui
            You can refer to "# Description" where all options are described and explained.

        # Cleaning :

            You can clean all created files by typing :
                make clean

        
        # Description :

            First, you have to choose the paramaters that you want.
            When you have finished, click on the button "Start the simulation".
            A new window will pop with

        # Quiting :

            You can quit the program at any time by clicking on the cross at the top right.
	   
   ## Algorithm :
        # Compilation :
           Go to the Algo directory :
                   src/Algo/
           Then to compile the program and generate the executable file :
                   make
           When you compile theses files are used :
                   -List.h
                   -Graph.h
                   -Floyd.c
           Dijkstra.c is not use and we won't compile it for the first defense.
           We will speak about this one for the next one.

        # Execution :
           Once the program has been compiled, you can run the Floyd program:
                   ./Floyd
           You can refer to "# Description" where all results are described and explained.

        # Cleaning :

           You can clean all created files by typing :
                   make clean

        # Description :
           First part you can see all edges of the graph we created.
           Second part you can see the result of the Floyd algorithm.
           It is a matrice where there are distances of each vertices from one of them.
           For example the first line is the distance of each vertices from the first one.
