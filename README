### How to use Chrono Park :
    

    ## Interface :


        # Compilation :

            Go to the GUI directory :
                cd src/GUI/
            Then to compile the program and generate the executable file :
                make gui

        
        # Execution :
        
            Once the program has been compiled, you can run the GUI program :
                ./gui
            You can refer to "# Description" where all options are described and explained.

        # Cleaning :

            You can clean all created files by typing :
                make clean

        
        # Description :

            First, you have to choose the paramaters that you want.
		You can choose :
			- the number of people
			- the number of attractions
			- the rain itensity (going from no rain to permanent rain)
			- run the program automatically
            When you have finished, click on the button "Start the simulation".
            A new window will pop with several options.
            On top left there are 2 numbers :
            	- time
            	- people remaining
            These numbers are usefull to see how the simulation evolves.
            Also, you can see from 2 to 12 attractions, depending the number you chosed
            in the parameters window. Next to each attractions there is a number which
            represents the number of people that are in the attraction. For each attraction
		you can see a colored square. If the square is green it means that there are not
		a lot of people. If it is orange then there are some people and when it's red it
		means there are a lot of people.
            On right top oyou can see a button named "Go to menu" that is usefull to stop
            the simulation and go back to the menu if you want to change parameters and
            start again.
		You can also see a list of the attractions and on top a button named "Validate".
		So first you need to check all the attractions that you want to visited then after
		clicking the button the red point will travel in the parc to all the attractions.
		Then after visiting all the attractions you wanted you can just click the "Leave"
		button to leave the parc.


        # Quiting :

            You can quit the program at any time by clicking on the cross at the top right.
	   

   ## Algorithm :


        # Compilation :
		
		Go to the GUI directory :
                	cd src/GUI/
            	Then to compile the program and generate the executable file :
                	make gui

        # Execution :

           	Once the program has been compiled, you can run the GUI program :
                	./gui
		You can refer to "# Description" where all results are described and explained.


        # Cleaning :

           	You can clean all created files by typing :
     	   		make clean


        # Description :

		1- First you can see all edges of the graph we created and the result of the 
			Floyd algorithm on the terminal when you start the simulation
		It is a matrice where there are distances of each vertices from one of them.
                For example the first line is the distance of each vertices from the first one.
           	
		2- Second part you can see on the rigth of the interface the list of minimum value 
			we need	to go to others attractions.


    ## IA :
	

	# Compilation :

		Go to the IA directory :
            src/IA/
        Then to compile the program and generate the executable file :
           	make
		

	# Execution :

		Once the program has been compiled, you can run the population program :
			./population
	

	# Cleaning :

		You can clean all created files by typing :
			make clean
	

	# Description :

		The program print every 2 seconds an overview of the park.
		You can see each attractions and the amount of people in the parc
		along with others parameters for each attractions.
		The only number that change between 2 prints is the number of people.
		So you can see people going from an attraction to another.
